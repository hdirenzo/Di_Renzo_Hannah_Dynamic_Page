FIP Project - Brand - Mericol's Pub Ale

Create a page that displays your team for the final project. 

Plan:

1. link css and js to html file
2. code html components
3. code css (i had to do this throghout the entire creation of the site because i'm still learning and i got confused)
4. code javascript - use let to identify the link class in document.QuerySelector for all links, let the imgs document.QuerySelector, add an EventListener on all link classes with the "click" funtion on toggle, so the images can be turned on and off, add prevent default to tell the css not to funcion as normal until called upon, use consol to check everything is working properly within the inspect element on the web browser (in my case Google Chrome).
5. Validate codes. 

Upon clicking links the event listener will be called, the employee images and figcaptions will be displayed as the function toggle.

When image hovered, it will be given 1.0 opacity. 

You can view one employee or all four at once since the captions connect in meaning. To close the employee click the box/link again.
